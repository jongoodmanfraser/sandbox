			If i input text here does it show up in the red???
			great what about ifg i continue with text will it stay out of the blue box (div div), or will it stay only in the red.....????????????????????????????????????
			yes it stayed out for now
			will c if it continues once the line with question marks has completed and a new live begins..............................................................
			I see.  It seems to be pushing the blue boxes down.  If I continue will it push the blue boxes of the page?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????   
			It does indeed also notice/remeber how the spaces after the question marks which begin this sentance are not noticed by the browser.   layout is not achie ed in this way??????
			Not correct      it is recognising layout spaces...sometimes     five sapces from sometimes
